# Mancala AI

Once you get a taste of the world of the winners, there's no going back

## How does it work?

Similar to my previously created [Connect Four AI](https://github.com/Nobody4931/connectfour),
this solver is also powered by the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm,
a popular decision making algorithm for maximizing the minimum gain in turn based games,
and further implements [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
for optimization purposes

## Why did you make this?

After completing my revenge against my friend in Connect Four using [my AI](https://github.com/Nobody4931/connectfour),
I thought about it for a bit, looked at the list of GamePigeon games that I frequently play,
saw Mancala, and went "yeah might as well" and here we are

The AI addiction doesn't stop, it doesn't stop, it never stops

I can see why all those major companies are scrambling to create their own AIs after the
release of ChatGPT now...
